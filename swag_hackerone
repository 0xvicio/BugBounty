--------------------------------
HackerOne offers swag at different reputation levels. 
The levels go 500 rep where we reach out to you. 

The rest of the levels require that you reach out to us as we do not have an automated process for this:
The next levels are 750, 1500, 2500, and then 5000.

I've also heard of people getting swag at 10000
